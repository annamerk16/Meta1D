🎯 Project Highlights

- Developed NLP techniques to detect and quantify social biases in text datasets using word embeddings and classification models.
- Identified biased semantic relationships and evaluated their impact on model predictions, supporting Meta’s Responsible AI initiatives.
- Created heatmaps, embedding plots, and bias trend metrics to clearly communicate findings.
- Delivered a fully documented, reproducible codebase aligned with ethical AI standards.

👩🏽‍💻 Setup and Installation




🏗️ Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program in partnership with Meta.

Objective

- Identify and analyze social biases present in NLP datasets, understand how they influence model outputs, and evaluate techniques for interpreting or mitigating bias.
  
Scope

- Detect biased terms and associations
- Use word embeddings to visualize semantic relationships
- Train simple classifiers to observe bias-driven prediction patterns
- Document findings and provide visual tools for interpretability

Real-World Significance

- Bias in training data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and lead to inequitable AI systems. Because Meta's platforms serve billions globally, mitigating dataset bias is essential for safety, fairness, and compliance with ethical AI standards.

📈 Results & Key Findings


🚀 Next Steps

- Expand datasets (especially religion-related biases; add non-Reddit sources).
- Test larger transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa-large).
- Apply domain adaptation techniques to improve cross-dataset robustness.
- Conduct deeper error analysis to reduce false positives/negatives.
- Improve user-facing prototype for wider deployment.
